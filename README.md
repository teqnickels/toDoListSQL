# toDoListSQL
The specs for this module are the same as the specs listed in the Command Line Todo List module except instead of fs.readFileSync and fs.writeFileSync you need to use the pg node module to store tasks in a Postgresql database.


## Command Line Todo List with SQL

This benchmark module is the 3rd of a series of modules designed to take the same problem and make it increasingly more complex as you learn new skills.

This module assumes you've already completed the Command Line Todo List With Callbacks module.

In this version we'll move from storing our tasks in a json file to storing them in a Postgresql SQL database.

# Skills

All the skills listed in the Command Line Todo List With Callbacks module plus:

Can describe the general programming term Defensive Programming
Can give two examples of "Defensive Programming" in JavaScript
Can design a schema and queries for a SQL Database
Description

See the description in the Command Line Todo List module.

# Specs:
